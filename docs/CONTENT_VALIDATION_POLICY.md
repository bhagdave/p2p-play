# P2P-Play Content Validation and Security Policy

## Overview

P2P-Play implements comprehensive input validation and sanitization to protect against security vulnerabilities and ensure a safe user experience across the distributed network.

## Security Threats Addressed

### 1. Terminal Injection Attacks
- **ANSI Escape Sequence Injection**: Malicious users could inject ANSI escape sequences to manipulate terminal display, potentially hiding malicious content or disrupting the user interface.
- **Terminal Control Character Injection**: Control characters can interfere with terminal operation and potentially be used for attacks.

### 2. Content-Based Attacks
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Extremely large content could consume excessive memory or storage.
- **Binary Data Injection**: Null bytes and binary data could interfere with string processing and storage.
- **Network Spam**: Unlimited message lengths could be used to flood the network.

### 3. Path Traversal
- **Directory Traversal**: File operations need protection against "../" style attacks.
- **Reserved Character Injection**: File names with system-reserved characters could cause issues.

## Content Validation Limits

### Length Limits
| Content Type | Maximum Length | Rationale |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Story Names | 100 characters | Reasonable title length while preventing UI overflow |
| Story Headers | 200 characters | Brief summary without excessive network overhead |
| Story Bodies | 10,000 characters | Substantial content while limiting resource usage |
| Channel Names | 50 characters | Clear identification without UI issues |
| Peer Names | 30 characters | Network-safe identifiers |
| Direct Messages | 1,000 characters | Reasonable message length for P2P communication |
| Node Descriptions | 2,000 characters | Detailed descriptions without excessive overhead |

### Character Set Restrictions

#### Peer Names (Most Restrictive)
- **Allowed**: Alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), dots (.)
- **Forbidden**: Spaces, special characters, Unicode symbols
- **Rationale**: Network safety and protocol compatibility

#### Channel Names (Moderately Restrictive)
- **Allowed**: Alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), underscores (_), dots (.)
- **Forbidden**: Spaces, special characters that could interfere with routing
- **Rationale**: Clear channel identification and routing safety

#### Story Names and Content (Least Restrictive)
- **Allowed**: Alphanumeric characters, common punctuation, spaces, newlines
- **Allowed punctuation**: . , ! ? ' " : ; ( ) - _
- **Forbidden**: Control characters, ANSI escapes, binary data
- **Rationale**: Natural language expression while maintaining security

## Sanitization Process

### Display Sanitization
All content displayed in the terminal undergoes sanitization:
1. **ANSI Escape Removal**: All `\x1b[...` sequences are stripped
2. **Control Character Removal**: Non-printable control characters are removed (preserving common whitespace)
3. **Binary Data Removal**: Null bytes and other binary data are filtered out

### Storage Sanitization
Content stored in the database is sanitized but preserves formatting:
1. **ANSI Escape Removal**: Security-focused removal of terminal sequences
2. **Selective Control Character Removal**: Preserves newlines and tabs for formatting
3. **Binary Data Removal**: Prevents null bytes and binary corruption

## Validation Implementation

### Validation Pipeline
1. **Input Parsing**: Extract user input from commands
2. **Content Validation**: Check length limits and character restrictions
3. **Content Sanitization**: Remove or escape dangerous content
4. **Storage**: Save validated and sanitized content
5. **Display**: Apply display-specific sanitization before showing content

### Error Handling
- **Clear Error Messages**: Users receive specific information about validation failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Invalid content is rejected without crashing the system
- **Logging**: Validation failures are logged for security monitoring

## Security Benefits

### Network Protection
- **Protocol Safety**: Restricted character sets prevent protocol confusion
- **Resource Management**: Length limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Spam Prevention**: Content limits reduce potential for network flooding

### Terminal Safety
- **Display Integrity**: ANSI escape filtering prevents terminal manipulation
- **User Interface Protection**: Content limits prevent UI overflow and corruption
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Character restrictions ensure proper display across operating systems

### Data Integrity
- **Storage Safety**: Sanitization prevents database corruption from binary data
- **Encoding Safety**: UTF-8 validation ensures proper character handling
- **File System Safety**: Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks

## Best Practices for Users

### Creating Content
- Use descriptive but concise names for stories and channels
- Avoid special characters in peer names and channel names
- Keep messages reasonably sized for better network performance

### Channel Management
- Use simple, memorable channel names (e.g., "tech-news", "general", "announcements")
- Avoid spaces in channel names to ensure compatibility

### Peer Communication
- Choose simple peer names without spaces or special characters
- Keep direct messages focused and appropriately sized

## Technical Implementation

### Validation Module Structure
```
src/validation.rs
├── ContentLimits      # Length limit constants
├── ValidationError    # Error types for validation failures
├── ContentSanitizer   # Sanitization functions
├── ContentValidator   # Content validation functions
└── SecurityValidator  # Security-focused validation utilities
```

### Integration Points
- **Command Handlers**: All user input validation
- **UI Display**: Content sanitization before display
- **Storage Operations**: Sanitization before database storage
- **Network Communication**: Validation of outgoing content

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent rapid-fire content creation
- **Content Filtering**: Optional profanity and spam detection
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: Verify content authenticity
- **Peer Reputation**: Track and limit problematic peers

### Monitoring Capabilities
- **Validation Metrics**: Track validation failure rates
- **Security Events**: Log potential security issues
- **Content Analysis**: Monitor content patterns for abuse detection

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards
- **Input Validation**: Follows OWASP input validation guidelines
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding for terminal display
- **Data Sanitization**: Secure handling of user-generated content

### Privacy Considerations
- **Content Inspection**: Validation does not store or analyze user content beyond security needs
- **Minimal Processing**: Only necessary validation steps are applied
- **User Control**: Users maintain control over their content within security boundaries
