This seems to be a way of doing the transport in the create_transport function. https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/blob/main/src/network/p2p.rs. Although I think this is a ittle more complex than I need for the moment.  

Also looking at the later chat example available at https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/master/examples/chat-tokio.rs
