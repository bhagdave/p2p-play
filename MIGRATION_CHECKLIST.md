# Migration Checklist

This checklist tracks the progress of separating P2P-Play into a network crate and frontend.

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Created workspace structure
- [x] Set up basic Cargo.toml files
- [x] Created network crate template files
- [x] Distributed source files between crates
- [x] Set up test structure

## üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Update imports in network crate
- [ ] Update imports in frontend crate  
- [ ] Implement network crate public API
- [ ] Remove network dependencies from frontend
- [ ] Update error handling interfaces
- [ ] Test network crate independently

## ‚è≥ Todo
- [ ] Clean up duplicate code between crates
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Add network crate examples
- [ ] Validate full application functionality
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines for workspace
- [ ] Publish network crate to crates.io

## Manual Steps Required

1. **Update Network Crate Imports**: Remove UI-specific imports from network modules
2. **Update Frontend Imports**: Change to use `p2p_network::*` instead of local modules
3. **Interface Adaptation**: Ensure the frontend uses only the public API from network crate
4. **Error Handling**: Update error types to work across crate boundaries
5. **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass in the new structure
6. **Documentation**: Update README files and examples

## Commands to Run After Migration

```bash
# Test network crate
cd p2p-network && cargo test

# Test frontend crate  
cd p2p-play-frontend && cargo test

# Test full workspace
cargo test

# Build full workspace
cargo build
```
