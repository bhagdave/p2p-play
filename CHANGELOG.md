# Changelog

All changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Show current alias when 'name' command is used without arguments
- Added test coverage for 'name' command functionality without arguments
- Test verifies that typing just 'name' shows current alias or helpful message if no alias is set
- File-based error logging system that writes errors to `errors.log` instead of displaying them in the UI
- New ErrorLogger module with timestamped error logging and comprehensive test coverage
- Added chrono dependency for UTC timestamps in error logs
- Added the clear output functionality for the TUI: Press 'c' in Normal mode to clear all output from the scrolling log area
- Added comprehensive test coverage for clear output functionality including edge cases and key binding integration
- Updated UI instructions and help text to include information about the clear output feature

### Changed
- Errors from story operations (list, create, publish) are now logged to file instead of being displayed in the UI
- Cleaner user interface experience with errors no longer cluttering the display
- Error logging includes fallback to stderr if file writing fails

## [0.5.0] - 2025-07-14

### Added
- Added Terminal User Interface (TUI) built with ratatui for improved user experience
- Multi-panel layout with status bar, output log, connected peers panel, and stories panel
- Interactive controls with keyboard navigation and visual feedback
- Real-time connection status updates and story sharing notifications
- Added "show story <id>" command to display full story details including header, body, and public status

### Performance
- Optimized peer name sorting performance with caching in direct message parsing
- Implemented SortedPeerNamesCache to maintain pre-sorted peer names, reducing complexity from O(n log n) per direct message command to O(1)
- Cache only updates when peer list changes (new peers, disconnections, name changes)
- Maintains identical functional behavior while significantly improving performance for direct messaging in environments with many peers


## [0.4.1] - 2025-07-13

### Changed
- Addressed deprecation warnings that were appearing during compilation by replacing deprecated floodsub type aliases with their non-deprecated equivalents.
- Fixed direct messaging failure when peer names contained spaces. The command msg Alice Smith Hello world was incorrectly parsed as sending "Smith Hello world" to peer "Alice" instead of sending "Hello world" to peer "Alice Smith".
- Modified peer name handling in handle_floodsub_event to check if name has changed
- Added proper logging for first-time names vs. changed names vs. unchanged names
- Ensures peer names are fixed when first received and only updated if they change


## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-07

### Added
- Direct messaging functionality between peers using alias names
- New `msg <peer_alias> <message>` command for sending private messages
- DirectMessage data structure with sender/receiver info and timestamp
- Message filtering to ensure only intended recipients see direct messages
- Visual indicators (ðŸ“¨ emoji) for received direct messages
- Command validation to ensure sender has set their name and recipient exists
- Comprehensive unit tests for direct messaging functionality

### Changed
- Updated JSON storage of stories from json to sqlite
- Refactored story management to use SQLite for persistent storage
- Updated peer alias storage to use SQLite instead of JSON
- Updated help text to include new messaging command
- Enhanced floodsub event handler to process DirectMessage types
- Extended event system to support direct message events
- Updated libp2p dependencies to latest version
- Removed unused dependencies and cleaned up Cargo.toml

### Technical Details
- Uses broadcast + filtering approach for message delivery
- Messages are sent via existing floodsub infrastructure but only displayed to intended recipients
- Future enhancement planned for true point-to-point messaging using libp2p request-response protocol
- SQLite database schema includes tables for stories and peer aliases

## [0.3.6] - 2025-07-06

### Added
- Creates stories.json file on startup on stories

### Changed
- Refactored the large event handling logic in main.rs by extracting it into a dedicated event_handlers.rs module

## [0.3.5] - 2025-07-05

### Added
- Interactive story creation mode: Users can now create stories by typing `create s` and being prompted for each element (name, header, body)
- Input validation for story creation with clear error messages for empty inputs
- Updated help text to show both interactive and legacy creation modes

### Changed
- Enhanced `create s` command to support both interactive mode (no arguments) and legacy pipe-separated format (with arguments)
- Improved user experience with guided prompts for story elements

## [0.3.4] - 2025-07-05

### Added
- Added persistent storage for peer aliases across application restarts
- Peer names are now automatically saved when set via the `name` command
- Saved peer names are loaded automatically on application startup
- Added comprehensive unit tests for peer name persistence functionality

### Changed
- Users no longer need to re-enter their alias after restarting the application
- Peer names are stored in JSON format in `./peer_name.json`

## [0.3.3] - 2025-07-04

### Fixed
- Fixed user command output to display without requiring RUST_LOG environment variable
- Replaced logging macros with direct console output for all user-facing commands (help, ls, create, publish, name)
- Commands now work immediately without needing logging configuration

## [0.3.2] - 2025-07-04

### Added
- Added New option 'name' to allow a peer to be aliased
