  - Messages automatically retry up to 3 times before reporting failure
  - Connection-based retries: pending messages retry when target peer reconnects  
  - Time-based retries: background task processes pending messages every 30 seconds
  - Silent operation: users only see final success/failure, not individual retry attempts
  - Configurable retry count, intervals, and enable/disable features via `direct_message_config.json`
  - Thread-safe message queue with Arc<Mutex<Vec<PendingDirectMessage>>> for concurrent access
  - Improved reliability of peer-to-peer communication with backward compatibility maintained

  - Enhanced command-line display: `üìñ Public | Channel: general | id: Story Name`
  - Added channel information to story details view for better organization
  - Different emoji indicators for public (üìñ) vs private (üìï) stories
- **Channel Broadcasting**: Implemented channel sharing functionality between P2P nodes to enable automatic propagation of channels across the network
  - Enhanced `create ch` command to broadcast newly created channels via floodsub to all connected peers
  - Added automatic reception and local storage of channels shared by other peers
  - Channels are serialized to JSON and transmitted using the existing floodsub infrastructure
  - Remote channels are automatically saved to local SQLite database upon reception
  - Provides user feedback for both channel creation ("Channel 'name' created successfully") and reception ("üì∫ Received channel 'name' from network")
  - Leverages existing P2P networking protocols for seamless channel distribution without requiring additional network configuration
- **Bootstrap Logging**: Added dedicated bootstrap.log file for bootstrap connection attempts and status updates to reduce TUI clutter
  - Created BootstrapLogger module with categorized logging levels (BOOTSTRAP_INIT, BOOTSTRAP_ATTEMPT, BOOTSTRAP_STATUS, BOOTSTRAP_ERROR)
  - All bootstrap activity now logged to bootstrap.log with UTC timestamps
  - Moved periodic bootstrap status logging from TUI to file for cleaner user interface
  - Bootstrap configuration loading and DHT connection status updates no longer appear in terminal interface
  - Fallback to standard logging if file operations fail

### Fixed
- **TUI Auto-scroll Re-enable Functionality**: Fixed issue where new messages were not immediately visible after re-enabling auto-scroll mode. When users pressed 'End' to re-enable auto-scroll after manual scrolling, the scroll offset was not properly reset, causing new messages to not be automatically displayed at the bottom of the output log. Enhanced the auto-scroll re-enable logic to reset the scroll offset when transitioning back to auto-scroll mode, ensuring new messages are immediately visible. Addresses feedback on PR for issue #102.
- **TUI Auto-scroll to Manual Scroll Transition**: Fixed jarring jump behavior when transitioning from auto-scroll to manual scrolling in the TUI. When auto-scroll was active and users pressed arrow keys to manually scroll, the view would incorrectly jump to the stored scroll offset (often position 0) instead of smoothly continuing from the current display position. Enhanced `scroll_up()` and `scroll_down()` methods to capture the current auto-scroll position before transitioning to manual scroll mode, providing an intuitive and seamless scrolling experience. Fixes issue #102.
- **TUI Connection Error Display**: Removed "Failed to connect" messages from TUI output while preserving error logging to `errors.log` file for debugging purposes. This eliminates unnecessary noise in the user interface while maintaining full error tracking capabilities. Fixes issue #100.
- Fixed test coverage reporting configuration with tarpaulin.
