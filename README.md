# p2p-play
Playing with p2p in Rust

This demo is taken from the [log rocket blog post](https://blog.logrocket.com/libp2p-tutorial-build-a-peer-to-peer-app-in-rust/) and the linked [Github Repo](https://github.com/zupzup/rust-peer-to-peer-example).  However, I have changed it from Recipes to stories as that is what I wanted to build.

I have also changed the code so that it works with a later version of the [libp2p library (0.50.1)](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.50.1).

I did start looking at moving to 0.51 but there seems to be a lot of breaking changes.
