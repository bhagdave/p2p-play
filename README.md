# p2p-play
This is a toy project working with the [libp2p library](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p) in Rust

This project was originally taken from the [log rocket blog post](https://blog.logrocket.com/libp2p-tutorial-build-a-peer-to-peer-app-in-rust/) and the linked [Github Repo](https://github.com/zupzup/rust-peer-to-peer-example).  However, I have considerably changed it since then so it may not resemble the original.

The basic functionality is to share stories amongst peers in a peer to peer network.  This has to be done via the command line running specific commands.  You can run through the code to see what commands are available.

I have also changed the code so that it works with the latest version of the [libp2p library (0.56.0)](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.56.0).

I should also add that I am using this project to test different code assistants and see how they work and how to integrate them into a normal workflow.
