# Network Crate Compilation Fix

Testing the network crate compilation after fixing syntax errors:

## Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ Removed duplicated method definitions outside impl block
2. ✅ Fixed bootstrap service method signature 
3. ✅ Updated error handling in bootstrap
4. ✅ Fixed Option handling for services

## Test Command:
```bash
cd p2p-network
cargo check
```

Should now compile without the syntax error!
