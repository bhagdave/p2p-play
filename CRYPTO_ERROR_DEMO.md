# Demonstration of Improved Crypto Error Messaging

This document shows the before and after user experience for messaging offline peers.

## The Problem (Before)

When users tried to message an offline peer, they would see confusing technical errors:

```
> msg alice Hello there
❌ Failed to create relay message: Crypto error in relay: Encryption failed: Public key not found for peer 12D3KooW...
```

**Issues with this message:**
- Technical jargon: "Crypto error", "Public key not found"
- No explanation of why this happened
- No guidance on what to do next  
- Unclear if message will be delivered later

## The Solution (After)

Now users see helpful, user-friendly messages:

```
> msg alice Hello there
📡 Trying relay delivery to alice...
🔐 Cannot send secure message to offline peer 'alice'
📥 Message queued - will be delivered when alice comes online and security keys are exchanged
ℹ️  Tip: Both peers must be online simultaneously for secure messaging setup
```

**Benefits of the new messages:**
- ✅ Clear explanation: peer is offline
- ✅ Reassurance: message is queued for delivery
- ✅ Educational: explains secure messaging requirements
- ✅ No technical jargon
- ✅ Consistent behavior: queuing still works

## Technical Implementation

The fix was implemented by:

1. **Error Detection**: Pattern matching on `RelayError::CryptoError(CryptoError::EncryptionFailed(msg))` where `msg.contains("Public key not found")`
2. **User-Friendly Messages**: Replace technical errors with helpful explanations
3. **Maintain Functionality**: Message queuing continues to work as before

## Code Changes

Only one function was modified (`try_relay_delivery` in `handlers.rs`) with surgical precision:

```rust
// Check if this is a missing public key error (offline peer scenario)
if let RelayError::CryptoError(CryptoError::EncryptionFailed(msg)) = &e {
    if msg.contains("Public key not found") {
        // User-friendly message for offline peer without public key
        ui_logger.log(format!(
            "🔐 Cannot send secure message to offline peer '{to_name}'"
        ));
        ui_logger.log(format!(
            "📥 Message queued - will be delivered when {to_name} comes online and security keys are exchanged"
        ));
        ui_logger.log(format!(
            "ℹ️  Tip: Both peers must be online simultaneously for secure messaging setup"
        ));
        return false;
    }
}
```

This minimal change addresses the specific user experience issue without affecting the underlying security or functionality.
